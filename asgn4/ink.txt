        Bob gives an incredibly poor apology. I think the problem is he doesn't believe in the words he's saying. He's just saying things that he thinks sound apologetic, but in reality come off as condescending and disconnected.

I type around 30 words per minute... so the last one should take around 15 minutes. If I start at 11:45pm on Sunday night, I should have enough time to finish this assignment! I'll start at 11:30pm to be safe.

    ** [ok] -> x33
* {g == "invincible"} [Use superpower]
    ~ i = i + 1
    {f} is invicible, so just beats up everyone else and escapes! Being invincible should be nerfed next patch

    {f} turns invisible during the interview, which uh oh, harms his reputation among the people.
