# InkyProject
Assignment 4 for CMPM 148

## Callbacks
Here are ten callbacks included in my Inky project:
1. **spoon**. Bob has the option to pick up a spoon in the first dialogue tree. Later, he can interact with the spoon when The Matrix crosses his mind.
2. **flexible** (variable 'adjective'). Bob can discover early on that he can touch his toes. This gives him the option to touch his toes in later scenes.
3. **Multivac** (variable 'a'). If Bob talks to Multivac in his first deliberation, then he can later consult Multivac for advice when facing his boss.
4. **breathing** (variable 'b'). Bob has the option to breathe repeatedly. If he chooses to do so, then he later has the option to remark about the importance of breathing.
5. **contempt**. If Bob's conversation with Joe lasts too long, Bob can build up a lot of contempt. Later, he can express his anger.
6. **diarrhea**. Early on, Bob decides if he has diarrhea or not. In the last level of the game, the player is quizzed on whether Bob had diarrhea.
7. **walk** (variable 'c'). One of Multivac's responses might recommend Bob to go for a walk. Later, the game suggests the player should go for a walk.
8. **rewatches_matrix**. Bob might ponder if life is a simulation, which leads him to planning to rewatch The Matrix. Later, the player can watch The Matrix.
9. **roses**. While arguing with Joe, Bob has the option to pause his argument to smell some roses. Later, the player can smell roses in a tense situation.
10. **superpower** (variable 'g'). In the final scene, the player customizes their superhero's name and superpower. Throughout the final scene, the name and superpower is referenced.
